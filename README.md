# Anime and Manga Recommendation System

This repository shows a simple deployment of an anime and manga recommendation system model using FastAPI. It only uses sample of data (5 record) for demonstration purposes.

The model is taken from my Bachelor thesis experiment result and [demo](./Demo_CDRS.ipynb). The demo is tidy and doesn't include the scraper, cleaning routine, and other tests.

My experiment are published as paper and it can be accessed [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9946560)
